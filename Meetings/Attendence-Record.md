# Purpose
This page will be updated every time a meeting is held.

The bi-daily meetings are "stand-ups", mimicking the daily stand-ups in the Scrum framework.\
We discuss briefly about individual's progress, plans, and issues, all under 15 minutes.\
These are currently not recorded.

Currently, we have met up as a full group for pair programming sessions - the actual tasks are still done in pairs, but should there be any questions we can all openly discuss together.
