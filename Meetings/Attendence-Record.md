# Purpose
This page will be updated every time a meeting is held.

The bi-daily meetings are "stand-ups", mimicking the daily stand-ups in the Scrum framework.\
We discuss briefly about individual's progress, plans, and issues, all under 15 minutes.\
These are currently not recorded.

In sprint 2, we have revised the pair programming structure. See [Git Branching Structure](/Documentation/Git-Branching-Structure).

In sprint 1, we have met up as a full group for pair programming sessions - the actual tasks are still done in pairs, but should there be any questions we can all openly discuss together.
