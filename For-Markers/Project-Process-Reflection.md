# Belbin Roles

### Available Belbin roles and impact on team performance
As recorded in the [first preliminary meeting](/Meetings/Team-Meeting-01) (conducted before sprint 1), we have the following Belbin roles available in our team:

|Member  |CW|SH|CF|PL|ME|CH|TW|RI|SP|
|--------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Dante @sc18d2s   |   |   |   |   | Secondary |   | Primary |  |  |
|Li @sc18hl       |   | Secondary |   |   |  | Primary |  |  |  |
|Jasmine @sc18jt  |   | Primary |   | Secondary |  |   |  |  |  |
|Jason @sc18z2h   | Primary |   |   |   |  |   |  |  |  |
|Lewis @sc18lags  |   |   | Primary |   |  | Secondary |  |  |  |
|Vincent @sc18cwl | Secondary |   |   | Primary |  |   |  |  |  |

When we give each person 3 points (2 for primary, 1 for secondary) to normalize and sum up the available Belbin roles as a team, we have the following table for the type of roles (aggregated according to the table in FAQ, page 1 of [this](https://www.belbin.com/media/1336/belbin-for-students.pdf))

| Type                                  | Points |
|---------------------------------------|--------|
| Action-Oriented Roles (CW, SH, CF)    | 8      |
| People-Oriented Roles (CH, TW, RI)    | 5      |
| Thinking-Oriented Roles (PL, ME, SP)  | 4      |

### What were the identified strengths of the team? 
This team is almost 50% action-oriented. We are capable of doing things rather than carefully planning. This fits the Agile methodology well - iterative design, fail fast, embrace change, less long-term planning. We can interpret that our team will be well organized (due to CW); we have an implicit guarantee that we will finish the project (due to CF). 

Since we have a team member with Shaper as the primary role, she naturally became the ScrumMaster, where her manager-fitting personality (according to the role) can shine the best.

### What were the identified weaknesses? 
#### Arose from low ratio of Role
Since we only have 1 possible candidate (Dante) for both Monitor/Evaluator and Team Worker, our team lacks a strong foundation for making critical decisions (ME's strength). This would be extremely valuable during planning meetings as we define what we should achieve in a sprint. We might decide unrealistically or not fully consider the different possibilities carefully, causing us to overestimate what we could do in a sprint (and hence appear to underachieve); when implementing some feature, we might not be able to decide on a good solution, and hence requiring us to change the original solution over and over.\
Our team might also not work harmoniously (TW's strength) enough - people might prefer to work separately, or even argue with each other on different opinions in how to do things. This implies integrating the work from each person (or each pair, since we will be doing pair programming) might be a difficult task.

#### Arose from high ratio of role
This team might be inflexible for change (due to CW) - this is a really severe warning, as it violates the core of the Agile methodology. 

---

### What mitigation was required to ensure the team worked well together?
To combat the identified weaknesses, we regularly met up and discussed our progress since the last 2 days, as well as holding pair programming sessions together as a team in DEC10. This helped our team bond together to ensure we can work harmoniously.

At times when we inevitably have conflicts, one of us would step down and listen to the others' opinion/idea, even if some of us are somewhat inflexible according to the Belbin roles.

Unfortunately, some of us had to give up their primary Belbin roles to "fill the gap" in order for the team to work better together. Namely, Vincent sacrificed the position as a Plant, and took the position as a Shaper instead, because the team needed more motivation to push forward, surprisingly.

# Impact due to the pandemic

### Impact of working off-campus and separated on your project
It was around the end of Sprint 2 when the university discouraged face-to-face interactions. We were fortunate enough to have our Sprint 2 review meeting with Amy. However, this still meant our whole Sprint 3 had to be carried out off-campus and separated.

#### Online Meetings
Our bi-daily meetings had to be conducted online - we simply called online via Microsoft Teams, where we already had a group for textual reminders and discussions since Sprint 1. In theory, doing meetings online should improve the punctuality and chances of team members showing up, for it is convenient to simply pop on with a laptop or on a mobile phone. However, the reality was much different - the turn up rate was much lower as some team members struggled to stay focused and on track on the project. 

Net result: we were not able to communicate as effectively as we did face-to-face, in the first 2 sprints. This meant our ScrumMaster could not keep track of the progress of individual members, and those that did not show up as often had trouble following up with the rapid, agile-style changes we were making to the project.

#### Working together... online?
Similar to the meetings situation, in the first 2 sprints, we regularly held team coding sessions, where we pair programmed together in DEC-10. Working off-campus meant that we no longer have the privilege of working together in person. 

Again, we used Microsoft Teams to alleviate this problem. Pair programming online through a shared screen sounded like it would just be the same as in DEC-10 - everyone can still see the same code and even have access to it (thanks to Teams). Turns out, even though the technology side of things was solved, our interpersonal communication was more important. 

When we needed to demonstrate or discuss an idea, we couldn't simply draw on paper and use gestures - we needed to illustrate with a mouse on a computer screen! Drawing digitally and still communicating quick proved to be challenging. People lose focus very quickly when you are drawing digitally because you are no longer in the same room, sitting together face-to-face. Net result: we couldn't be sure that one idea was perceived and interpreted correctly by both members; \
this also meant paper prototyping is much less efficient, as we could no longer pass around the design for everyone to see - we needed to take a photo of it (because some don't have scanners at home) and ask people to read it. When you don't shove the design that needs feedback to a person's face, but only *asking* people to read them individually online, they simply won't do it (whether they forgot or just don't have to motivation to do it) - just like the pile of emails that gets ignored in our mailboxes. While this is completely understandable, it meant the quality of communication has deteriorated a lot. Often, people can't get their ideas through to another person's head.

#### Falling behind
Doing things that were previously done physically, digitally, meant that there is extra overhead in the time taken to do them. We needed to get used to our new environment, new tools, and new formats of how to do things. Meanwhile, deadlines for other courseworks were closing in ruthlessly; some of us were mentally challenged and hence couldn't work as efficiently. Evidently, some of us wanted to focus on other parts of their lives after the announcement that this module will not have a numerical grade, so they simply opted to not work on this project anymore.

#### The Positive Aspects
Some of us had a different mindset. As the project's revised requirements turns into a blurred mist of goals, they wanted to take the project more seriously, and develop it as their portfolio piece. They elevate the requirements to another level and tried as best as they can, as the lockdown situation has granted them much more freedom and time to work on it. Even though they had to work online, they made up for it with frequent communication, working via Teams and willing to try out a wide range of different options, as well as collecting good designs for reference.

### Tools or processes that functioned well in this environment & Reasons
We used Microsoft Teams and Facebook's Messenger as the main channels of online communication. These worked naturally and were seamlessly integrated into this new environment. This is mainly because we had been using them since Sprint 1, so we did not need to relearn how to use them again.

For discussions that needed to be recorded, we used [Google Docs](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1dFHQ44MgV2HX5YGJOGtv00Ihh7cH_C_vOREMbwLKXu8) and [Google Spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1k-ubHstqQHhVJ7CCC1BqzZZpsBI-YF3zz7E-1m4k5d0). Again, we had been using them since Sprint 1, so they were easy to picking up on. Organizing ideas digitally is also more convenient than doing it with paper (although jogging notes down during a discussion is still more efficient on paper).

---

### What tools or processes were more difficult and why?
Because people refused to show up later on, our team size had basically shrunk down to 2 members. This naturally reduced our efficiency in polishing the project. Hence, in terms of working processes, we would frequently need to communicate with digital drawings. This posed great difficulty as one of us is very accustomed to drawing on paper - making this transition and still communicate as effectively as on paper was not easy.

---

### Briefly, what was the overall impact on the planned delivery of your product?
Despite the pandemic, we were still able to complete all the essential requirements that are in the project backlog. However, we could not finish a lot of the side issues discovered during developing and testing (as shown in the issue tracker).

We were unable to get feedback from Sprint 3 - which would have been immensely useful if we could do a review meeting with a module leader face-to-face, demonstrating the implemented functionality and design. We kept asking for a clarification on some requirement since the beginning of Sprint 2 by sending emails and hunting for Mark in person, but due to the pandemic, this was to no avail, and we interpreted the confusing requirement in our own way.
