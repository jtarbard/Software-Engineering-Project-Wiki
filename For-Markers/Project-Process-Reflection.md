# Belbin Roles

### Available Belbin roles and impact on team performance
As recorded in the [first preliminary meeting](/Meetings/Team-Meeting-01) (conducted before sprint 1), we have the following Belbin roles available in our team:

|Member  |Company Worker|Shaper|Completer/Finisher|Plant|Monitor/Evaluator|Chair|Team Worker|Resource Investigator|Specialist|
|--------|--------------|------|------------------|-----|-----------------|-----|-----------|---------------------|----------|
|Dante   |   |   |   |   | Secondary |   | Primary |  |  |
|Li      |   | Secondary |   |   |  | Primary |  |  |  |
|Jasmine |   | Primary |   | Secondary |  |   |  |  |  |
|Jason   | Primary |   |   |   |  |   |  |  |  |
|Lewis   |   |   | Primary |   |  | Secondary |  |  |  |
|Vincent | Secondary |   |   | Primary |  |   |  |  |  |

When we gave each person 3 points (2 for primary, 1 for secondary) to normalize and sum up the available Belbin roles as a team, we have the following:

| Role                  | Points | Comment |
|-----------------------|--------|---------|
| Company Worker        | 3      | 
| Shaper                | 3      |
| Plant                 | 3      |
| Chair                 | 3      |
| Completer/Finisher    | 2      |
| Team Worker           | 2      |
| Monitor/Evaluator     | 1      |
| Resource Investigator | 0      |
| Specialist            | 0      |

# Impact due to the pandemic

### Impact of working off-campus and separated on your project
It was around the end of Sprint 2 when the university discouraged face-to-face interactions. We were fortunate enough to have our Sprint 2 review meeting with Amy. However, this still meant our whole Sprint 3 had to be carried out off-campus and separated.

#### Online Meetings
Our bi-daily meetings had to be conducted online - we simply called online via Microsoft Teams, where we already had a group for textual reminders and discussions since Sprint 1. In theory, doing meetings online should improve the punctuality and chances of team members showing up, for it is convenient to simply pop on with a laptop or on a mobile phone. However, the reality was much different - the turn up rate was much lower as some team members struggled to stay focused and on track on the project. 

Net result: we were not able to communicate as effectively as we did face-to-face, in the first 2 sprints. This meant our ScrumMaster could not keep track of the progress of individual members, and those that did not show up as often had trouble following up with the rapid, agile-style changes we were making to the project.

#### Working together... online?
Similar to the meetings situation, in the first 2 sprints, we regularly held team coding sessions, where we pair programmed together in DEC-10. Working off-campus meant that we no longer have the privilege of working together in person. 

Again, we used Microsoft Teams to alleviate this problem. Pair programming online through a shared screen sounded like it would just be the same as in DEC-10 - everyone can still see the same code and even have access to it (thanks to Teams). Turns out, even though the technology side of things was solved, our interpersonal communication was more important. 

When we needed to demonstrate or discuss an idea, we couldn't simply draw on paper and use gestures - we needed to illustrate with a mouse on a computer screen! Drawing digitally and still communicating quick proved to be challenging. People lose focus very quickly when you are drawing digitally because you are no longer in the same room, sitting together face-to-face. Net result: we couldn't be sure that one idea was perceived and interpreted correctly by both members; \
this also meant paper prototyping is much less efficient, as we could no longer pass around the design for everyone to see - we needed to take a photo of it (because some don't have scanners at home) and ask people to read it. When you don't shove the design that needs feedback to a person's face, but only *asking* people to read them individually online, they simply won't do it (whether they forgot or just don't have to motivation to do it) - just like the pile of emails that gets ignored in our mailboxes. While this is completely understandable, it meant the quality of communication has deteriorated a lot. Often, people can't get their ideas through to another person's head.

#### Falling behind
Doing things that were previously done physically, digitally, meant that there is extra overhead in the time taken to do them. We needed to get used to our new environment, new tools, and new formats of how to do things. Meanwhile, deadlines for other courseworks were closing in ruthlessly; some of us were mentally challenged and hence couldn't work as efficiently;
