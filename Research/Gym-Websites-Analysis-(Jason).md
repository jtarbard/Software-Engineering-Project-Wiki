**TL;DR**

Obviously let’s use the standard patterns (breadcrumbs tabs, fat footer, home button, social media links, etc...)

But other than that, consider these ideas:

Let’s include (if possible)
* Scroll-up button
* Reset cookies button
* Search bar
* Background pictures (that don’t scroll with the screen)
* Wide pictures need top and bottom cropped in desktop mode (otherwise it will be too large like in the Edge website)
* Links to different sports with cartoon icons
* Find gym button (convenience)
* Opening times, address, contact details sections (convenience)
* Lots of white space (it helps to keep the page looking clean)
* Consistent layout width between different sections
* Consistent colour scheme for important buttons (bright) and less important buttons (less bright)
* News section (both websites have them, but this would be a lot of unnecessary work)

Let’s avoid
* Having to scroll down to see important stuff (booking, membership, view sports, join)
* Repeating elements like contact details and social media links (just put them in one place)
* Big pictures that cover the entire screen
* Dark patterns like limited-time offers, because we’re ***ethical***

We should decide if the good patterns are feasible or not. Because I don’t know what Flask is capable of.


**The Edge**

The good:
* Search to query for specific keywords
* Scroll-up button (clicking it scrolls back to the top of the page)
* A cookie clear button (the padlock icon next to the scroll-up button in picture 2)
* The pictures stay in the background (looks very smooth when scrolling)
* Links to every sport with cartoon icons (intuitive to use)

The bad:
* The home button logo on the opposite side of the usual spot
* There two more redundant home buttons on the left (only 1 present in mobile view)
* You need to scroll down to view the important sections (booking, membership, view sports)

The ugly:
* Some pictures are too big in desktop view (because it’s designed for mobile)
* There are many elements being repeated (social media, search bars, contacts, news)
* Inconsistent colour scheme

    Eg. media link buttons white used for cookie pop-up confirm button. But gold used for other important buttons.
    Dull black used for some important buttons.


**Xercise4Less**

The good:
* Find a gym button (maps are useful)
* Big yellow buttons that are useful (join the Leeds gym now)
* Lots of white space! (feels clean)
* Wide pictures have top and bottom cropped in desktop mode
* Really in your face about its gender equality
* Nice yellow color used as highlighter

The bad:
* Dark patterns (fake exclusivity “Promo Code: 5GYM”, time constraint “Get Fit for February”, camouflaged advert banners)
* Lots of repeated join buttons

The ugly:
* The horrible paragraph with center-aligned text, a **WIDE** middle, and *narrow* ends.
* Inconsistent layout widths
* Randomly isolated things without headers (Classes timetable button and the map)
