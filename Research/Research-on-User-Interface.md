# Post-cognitive walkthrough heuristic evaluation

Nielsen’s original heuristics for UIs:

1. Visibility of system status. System keeps informing the user on what’s going on. Feedback provided in reasonable time. 
2. Match the real world. The system “speaks the users’ language” Real-world conventions. Natural and logical order of information. 
3. User control and freedom. Users often choose system functions by mistake. Provide “emergency exit” from unwanted states. 
4. Consistency and standards. Conventions of the platform should be obeyed. 
5. Error prevention. Eliminate error-prone conditions. Don’t let them happen. Confirmation option.
6. Recognition rather than recall. Relevant objects and options are visible. The user is not requested to remember information. 
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use. Provide keyboard shortcuts (accelerators). Accommodate both novice and power users. 
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design. Only relevant information is shown. (Each unit of information competes with all other units of information.) 
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. Error messages in plain language. Precise indication and constructive suggestion of a solution.
10. Help and documentation. Minimal, easy to search.

# Evaluation of Design Patterns
### The Edge website

The Edge website has a responsive design which changes between a compact and full view depending on the width of the viewing window.

A design pattern exclusive to the full view is a navigation bar with navigation tabs. These tabs expand into a combination of horizontal and vertical dropdown menus, serving as a means of progressive disclosure.

A design pattern exclusive to the compact view is a hamburger button in the top right corner. This button opens a menu containing the same features as the navigation bar but instead organised as an accordion menu.

All other design patterns are shared between both views with a slightly altered layout. There is a home link, although it links to the University homepage rather than the Edge homepage. The immediate focus of the page is a carousel featuring offers relating to gym memberships. Below this is an array of thumbnails linking to different subsections of the site. At the bottom of each page is a fat footer containing contact information and useful links.

The membership purchasing page features a number of design patterns relating to shopping. One of these is the isolation effect, used here to highlight the most expensive membership options by surrounding them in larger boxes. Attempting to back out of a purchase shows an unskippable modal window asking you to confirm, using a long goodbye approach to keep you on the page.

The page uses grouping by separating similar sections into horizontal segments with different backgrounds and most pages have a list of navigation links at the right side.

Navigating the site was made difficult by the exclusion of a breadcrumb menu and the lack of a useful home link. Some features only appear when the site is scrolled to a certain level which gives the illusion of continuous scrolling, though seeing as the site has a fixed amount of content this feature seems unnecessary and distracting.
