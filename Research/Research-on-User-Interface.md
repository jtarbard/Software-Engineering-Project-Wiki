**Task:** Register as a new member of *Xercise4less* on web\
**Users:** People with no prior experience on how \
**Context & Technology:** User is trying to sign up during his lunch hour on his laptop, while having his lunch. He is somewhat distracted.\
**Workflow (done with cognitive walkthrough):**

| Step | Understand the Correct Action? | Perform? | Associate and Interpret? |
|------|-----|------|-----|
| 1. Google the website and click on the link to the homepage | **No** – not obvious that clicking on the map (occupied half of the screen) showing its location does not lead to the website. **[Low severity]** | Yes – user expected to be able to type and click                                                          | Yes – clicking on the link leads to the homepage                                                                                                                  |
| 2. Click “Join Now”                                         | Yes – there is a big “Join Now” button in vibrant yellow at the centre of the screen, as well as at the top right corner                                                                                                                                                           | Yes – button functional                                                                                   | Yes – clicking on the button leads to another page, saying New Membership, which makes the purpose of this page clear                                             |
| 3. Choose a gym close to user’s location                    | Yes – only a dropdown list telling the user to find a gym is shown.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Yes – the dropdown list is responsive.                                                                    | Yes – upon choosing the gym location, the row gets “confirmed” by a tick next to the “Home Gym” field. The dropdown list also disappears.                         |
| 4. Choose a membership type                                 | Yes – Brief description of each type is described.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Yes – buttons responsive                                                                                  | Yes – clicking on the buttons turns the button green, while the old type turns grey to signal it has been deselected                                              |
| 5. Choose a package                                         | **No** – despite a “Next steps” button with vibrant colours and good contrast with other elements is shown at the bottom right corner, it is not obvious that is the necessary action (e.g. user might expect choosing a membership type would have already led them to the next step) **[medium severity]** | Yes – the “Next Steps” button is functional                                                               | Yes – clicking on “Next steps” takes you to a page to fill in the account details.                                                                                |
| 6. Fill in Account Details                                  | Yes – the fields that require filling has a classic white textbox look, alongside concise names of each field. | Yes – typing makes text appear                                                                            | **No** – upon filling in all details, nothing happens (making the “Next steps” button grey, then highlighting it when all the details are filled in would solve this) **[Low severity]** |
|   | In addition, there is detection for whether the entered email address exists (not just by checking the domain name). This is potentially handled by the external website “thechecker.co” |  |  |
| 7. Fill in Personal Details                                 | Yes – classic textbox & dropdown list indicate information needs to be filled in                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Yes – interacting with the widgets change their states in some way (e.g. button highlights, text appears) | **No** – upon filling in all details AND clicked on “Next Steps”, nothing changes **[high severity]** |
|  |  |  | (This happened because the page was refreshed, and the selected gym choice was not stored) |
| 8. Enter Payment Details                                    | Yes – classic textboxes and buttons indicate information needs to be filled in   | Yes – interaction functional | !! Research terminated – actual payment required !! |


# Post-cognitive walkthrough heuristic evaluation

Nielsen’s original heuristics for UIs:

1. Visibility of system status. System keeps informing the user on what’s going on. Feedback provided in reasonable time. 
2. Match the real world. The system “speaks the users’ language” Real-world conventions. Natural and logical order of information. 
3. User control and freedom. Users often choose system functions by mistake. Provide “emergency exit” from unwanted states. 
4. Consistency and standards. Conventions of the platform should be obeyed. 
5. Error prevention. Eliminate error-prone conditions. Don’t let them happen. Confirmation option.
6. Recognition rather than recall. Relevant objects and options are visible. The user is not requested to remember information. 
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use. Provide keyboard shortcuts (accelerators). Accommodate both novice and power users. 
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design. Only relevant information is shown. (Each unit of information competes with all other units of information.) 
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors. Error messages in plain language. Precise indication and constructive suggestion of a solution.
10. Help and documentation. Minimal, easy to search.

# Evaluation of Design Patterns
### The Edge website

The Edge website has a responsive design which changes between a compact and full view depending on the width of the viewing window.

A design pattern exclusive to the full view is a navigation bar with navigation tabs. These tabs expand into a combination of horizontal and vertical dropdown menus, serving as a means of progressive disclosure.

A design pattern exclusive to the compact view is a hamburger button in the top right corner. This button opens a menu containing the same features as the navigation bar but instead organised as an accordion menu.

All other design patterns are shared between both views with a slightly altered layout. There is a home link, although it links to the University homepage rather than the Edge homepage. The immediate focus of the page is a carousel featuring offers relating to gym memberships. Below this is an array of thumbnails linking to different subsections of the site. At the bottom of each page is a fat footer containing contact information and useful links.

The membership purchasing page features a number of design patterns relating to shopping. One of these is the isolation effect, used here to highlight the most expensive membership options by surrounding them in larger boxes. Attempting to back out of a purchase shows an unskippable modal window asking you to confirm, using a long goodbye approach to keep you on the page.

The page uses grouping by separating similar sections into horizontal segments with different backgrounds and most pages have a list of navigation links at the right side.

Navigating the site was made difficult by the exclusion of a breadcrumb menu and the lack of a useful home link. Some features only appear when the site is scrolled to a certain level which gives the illusion of continuous scrolling, though seeing as the site has a fixed amount of content this feature seems unnecessary and distracting.
