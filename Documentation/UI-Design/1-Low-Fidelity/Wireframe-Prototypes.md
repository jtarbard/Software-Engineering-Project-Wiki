#### Idea
##### Sprint 1
The frontend pair intended to create a wireframe prototype of the homepages for Guest and Existing_Customer individually without interference, then combine both ideas to create the final wireframe prototype. Then, the wireframe prototype is evaluated and

##### Later Sprints
Creating wireframe prototypes in general draws up some implementation theories, and allows team members to communicate effectively. So, we kept doing them when polishing the UI collaboratively.

#### Counter Arguments
This has been proven to be slightly too time-consuming to fit in one sprint:
* It reveals a long list of implicit design choices that should be carefully considered, e.g. cookie pop-up style, navbar behaviours;
* Applying the same prototype technique for **every** page would be a lot of work that mostly goes to waste as wireframe prototypes are not deliverables. This also violates one of the Scrum framework principles;
* Doing this iteratively, increasing the fidelity of the prototypes for **all** pages would also mean a lot of work that does not necessarily produce valuable deliverables. See above.

#### Result
Nonetheless, this was still carried out partially to excite discussion and generate ideas for the homepages.

#### Next Steps
We have skipped the formal combination of wireframe designs - we picked out the good bits in each design verbally and had come to an agreement. We have also skipped the formal evaluation + documentation in attempt to be agile.

However, attempting to implement the semi-polished UI in the first Sprint would be quite difficult, so we decided to skip straight to a high-fidelity prototype, [artboard](/Documentation/UI-Design/2-High-Fidelity/Artboard), so we can easily translate it into html code.
