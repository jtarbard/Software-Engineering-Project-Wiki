#### Idea
This is created in image editing softwares, such as Photoshop or Illustrator.

With an artboard, we can translate it directly to html code, but also leaving us with a lot of freedom to fiddle with. Essentially, it will look like a snapshot of the website, unless we decide to change it significantly (notice translation is also an iteration of prototyping).

#### Result

@sc18jt's Artboard, for the Guest homepage:
<details>
<summary>Expand/Collapse images</summary>
![Artboard_Guest](uploads/b67a746006964499fad7d13a5d8acef4/Artboard_Guest.png)
</details>

#### Next Steps
We have translated this successfully into html code, with the help of Bootstrap and Jinja2.
